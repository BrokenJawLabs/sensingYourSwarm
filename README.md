# Sensing Your Swarm Project

<p>Picture a thousand mini-robots which sense a dangerous location and this information allows to us determine a secured path although this space and avoid deathly objects in there. This is what our project attempts to display.</p>

<h3>Sensign an hazardous location with an swarm of random walkers</h3>

<p>Sensing your swarm proposes an idea that rig out humans to navigate in dangerous environment such as airplanes accidents, shipwrenks and outer space exploring situations. As a bio-inspired robotic system this proyect hands in an prototype which apes the random movement of flies swarms and applies to measurement of risky gases and deathly temperature in hazardous locations, those multiple measurement allows to graph into a web-page based into the combination of Ethernet and SPI protocol network, a secure path throughout field skipping obstacles. Furthermore, in this project a main robot performs as seeing eye dog which could guide a person along the secured path, while it plays the role of gateway towards the server interpreting multiplied nodes composed by each measurement terminal.</p>

<h3>Robotic comunication architecture toward user</h3>

<p>The robotic system's architecture is divided in three levels. At the lower place lies the mini-robots which randomly measure an field. Each of this independent units carries two sensors: one used to measure dangerous gases as butane or monoxide, and the otherone used to measure temperature levels. Moreover, these units also incopores and RF-module which based on the SPI protocol build an strar-shaped network architecture.</p>
